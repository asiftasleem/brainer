### Two Dimensional Spiral

To perceive a solution to this problem, think a virtual boundary that confines the x & y indecies.
This virtual boundary could be defined by left & top initialized to **-1** and right & bottom to **n**.
With these initial values, this boundary is first out side the 2D Array.
<br/>
With each iteration, this virtual boundary moves one step in.
